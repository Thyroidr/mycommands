# ~~my~~ourcommands
This repository contains `commands.tex`, a file which I use to write LaTeX documents. It is provided here in the hope that it may be useful for others.

Please note that things might be changed or removed so this document should not be relied on for backwards compatibility.

Look at the `template.tex` file for example usage of some of the things in `commands.tex`.

## To contribute

There are three cases for additional shortcuts:

- Common utilities that benefit most users, these should be added to `commands.tex`;
- Subject area specific commands, these should be added to `<subject-area>.tex`;
- Commands for personal habit, please do not add these.
